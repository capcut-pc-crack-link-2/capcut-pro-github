## How it works

First, the tool will extract the start time, the duration of the clips, and the video path from the draft info file.

Then it use ffmpeg to export specific clips, the command is like:

ffmpeg -ss 1 -t 3 -i /path/to/input.mp4 -c copy /path/to/output.mp4 -y
In the above command:

-ss means the start time of video.
-t means the duration of the video clip.
-c copy means copy media steam without re-encoding, so it's a lossless and fast process and won't lose video quality.
-y means automatic confirmation when needed, used to override if a file of the same name exists.
It means export a 3s' video clip to output.mp4 from 1s of input.mp4, and overwrite the output file if it already exists.

## Motivation
Sometimes when we finished video edit, there’ll be many clips in your editor track, and they usually comes from a single video. Anyway, we have a lot of video clips to export.

Assume that you want to archive the materials, how will you do? Just export one by one?

Actually most of editors don’t provide this functionality such as Jianying/CapCut, even if they do, the quality of the video will suffer after they re-encoded it.

So we need a lossless, fast, and simple way to manage to do it, this tool is made for this. It based on ffmpeg using stream copy without re-encoding, which won't lose quality.
